# _pusion_ – A framework for decision fusion

Pusion is a flexible framework for combining multiple classifier’s decisions in Python.

The framework accommodates a variety of fusion methods adapted from ensemble techniques and pattern recognition.
The general purpose is to improve the classification performance over the input classifiers and to determine the
compatibility of individual fusion methods to the given problem. Pusion handles an unlimited number of classifiers
and also tolerates different forms of classification outputs. These include the multiclass and multilabel
classification, as well as crisp and continuous class assignments.

The framework is originally designed for combining fault detection and diagnosis methods, but it’s application is not
limited to this area.
