pusion -- Decision Fusion Framework
=========================================

Pusion (Python Universal Fusion) is a flexible framework for combining multi-classifier decisions in Python.

The framework accommodates a variety of fusion methods adapted from ensemble techniques and pattern recognition.
The general purpose is to improve the classification performance over the input classifiers and to determine the
compatibility of individual fusion methods to the given problem.
Pusion handles an unlimited number of classifiers and also tolerates different forms of classification outputs.
This includes the multiclass and multilabel classification, as well as crisp and continuous class assignments.

The framework is originally designed for combining fault detection and diagnosis methods.
However, its application is not limited to this area.
