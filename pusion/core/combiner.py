class Combiner:
    """
    Combiner's root class. This class as well as the subclasses in this module set the structure for each combiner
    provided by the framework. It also accommodates methods and attributes which are essential for combiner's
    registration and obtainment.

    Each combiner to be registered in the framework, needs to base at least one of the following classes:

    - :class:`UtilityBasedCombiner`
    - :class:`TrainableCombiner`
    - :class:`EvidenceBasedCombiner`.

    Furthermore, it needs a `list` :attr:`_SUPPORTED_PAC` of supported PAC tuples set as a class attribute.
    A PAC tuple is a `tuple` of string constants (classification problem, assignment type and coverage type). See:

    - `pusion.util.constants.Problem`
    - `pusion.util.constants.AssignmentType`
    - `pusion.util.constants.CoverageType`

    respectively. Example of a new combiner:

    .. code:: python

        class NewCombiner(TrainableCombiner):

        _SUPPORTED_PAC = [
            (Problem.MULTI_CLASS, AssignmentType.CRISP, CoverageType.REDUNDANT),

            pass

        def combine(self, decision_outputs):

    .. warning::

        Note that a new combiner also needs to be inserted into the :class:`pusion.Method` class within
        `pusion.__init__.py` file.
